### Paper Rewriting - NMTology

---

- **Reviewer's comments**
  - Meta, 2
    - **lack of constructive suggestions to the reader**, a bit like TL;DRs $$\Rightarrow$$ try to use limited but well-chosen references with thorough description
    - **lack of in-depth investigation**, some parts are misleading (e.g. mixing NAT results with AT results)
  - 62e2, 4
    - no mention of rule-based MT in intro. part, no respect to rule-based MT
    - Reads a bit like a collection of TL;DRs
    - *Visually, the questions are difficult to distinguish from the subsubsections titles*
  - DFkb, 2.5
    - related works and the FAQs to be selected more carefully
    - Few suggestions, clues or conclusions are given for each subsection/FAQ
  - dwfc, 2
    - list some relevant work together is **not enough for a survey** $$\Rightarrow$$ summarize some useful conclusions for future researchers from previous work
    - too much related work, thus confusions e.g. AT and NAT
  - U3bj, 2
    - the provided related information for each question is very superficial, **lack of constructive suggestions to the readers**
    - **no quantitative comparisons** among the related works

---

**next version**

- directly address the FAQ

- paper's main contribution is not what we ask, so rewrite the question

- FAQ $$\Rightarrow$$ Topic-oriented (subject - perspectives)

---

修改意见：

- Sec. 7 limitation单独罗列
- 将FAQ调整topic形式组织与节标题构成更好的层次结构
- 额外贡献：FAQ额外提炼的关于NMT理解性问题，与大家讨论的开放性问题
