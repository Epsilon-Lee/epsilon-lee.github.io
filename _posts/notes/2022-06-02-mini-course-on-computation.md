### Introductory lecture

Speaking of computation, what does it precisely mean by **computation**?

- computation in different areas like technology, biology, math, physics
- different intuition of computation obtained from many sub-fields
- $$\Rightarrow$$ *computation has become an interdicplinary notion*

This course re-examines the notion of computation from intuitions in math, physics and biology.

- Why math?
  - Fundamentals (Turing machine=algorithm==mechanical procedure) -- Modern approach (Computational model beyond Turing machine, computational complexity, reduction) -- Philosophy (connection to reality)
- Why physics?
  - identifying constraints and structures
  - Classical approach (Newton's law, classical mechaniscs and statistical mechanics) -- Modern approach (Quantum computation) -- Philosophy
- Why biology?
  - collecting evidence piece by piece to Jigsaw
  - Biology-inspired algorithms -- The essence of natural computation (evolution, neuron science) -- Philosophy
- Connection of the above three
  - One-way function (hash function), very hard to invert
  - Chaotic phenomenon (butterfly effect): slightly different --physical dynamics-- totally different outcomes
  - Emergence properties (compositional results of 4 gene) --biological system-- totally different species

Goals:

- Give the audience a ground to appreciate the universal notion of computation
- How to do interdiciplinary research? Not different dictions but appreciation
