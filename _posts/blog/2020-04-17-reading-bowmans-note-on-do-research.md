> I think these two notes: [Note A](https://drive.google.com/file/d/155uXtw5GQsdEnSSwHNtsDSv0WEafBGwH/view) and [Note B](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ilAvEVIXZENL0VxfA5iaiA9U5_9GWvV0/view) are very useful guidelines for young researcher and researchers who get confused on what to do next like me, so I summarized them possibly in a paraphrased way.



For a successful project, you must:

1. Identify an open problem, present a hypothesis about it, and survey the relevant literature;
2. Design and run an experiment to test that hypothesis;
3. Analyze the results to reveal what your experiment tell us about your hypothesis.



#### Literature review

- Do this early! The reason:
  - Make sure that what you're doing hasn't already been done before.
    - If it has, and the paper is easy to find, you won't get full credit;
  - Learn about common methods, datasets, and libraries that will make you life easier
  - Buy yourself more time to think about the questions that *haven't* been answered in the literature

**How**

1. Do a keyword search on Google Scholar
2. Download the papers that seem most relevant
3. Skim the abstracts, intro, & previous work sections
4. Identify papers look relevant, appear often, & have lots of citations on Google Scholar
5. Download those papers
6. Return to 3

**Some guidelines**

- You'll have to use your judgment in deciding which papers to read, and which papers to trust
  - Papers can disagree with one another
  - You might just find too many papers

- Which paper will be most useful?
  - Newer ones that build on the paper you like most
  - Peer-reviewed paper
  - Published papers with negative results
- Finding negative results
  - Negative results are often reported as brief mentions in a paper that has mostly positive results
  - Look for gaps in the literature
    - GANs are hot outside NLP, why?

#### Organizing a project and doing good science
