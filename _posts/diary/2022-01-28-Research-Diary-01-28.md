### Is interpretable ML (IML) overpromising and underdelivering? `interpretale ml`

- An [article]() from ACM Queue about **current problems** of Interpretable ML (IML)
- `TL;DR` we describe some of the **obstacles** impeding progress in this field and propose a <u>'diagnostic'</u> vision for IML to overcome these obstacles.
  - **Problem**: a lack of clear evidence and usage guidelines for how IML (e.g. better trust and debugging) may actually help consumers.
  - **Solution**: researchers and consumers should work together to identify well-defined *target use cases* as part of developing a diagnostic treatment of IML methods.
