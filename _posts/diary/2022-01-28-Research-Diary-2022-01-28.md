#### Is interpretable ML (IML) overpromising and underdelivering? `interpretale ml`

- An [article]() from ACM Queue about **current problems** of Interpretable ML (IML)
- `TL;DR` we describe some of the **obstacles** impeding progress in this field and propose a <u>'diagnostic'</u> vision for IML to overcome these obstacles.
  - **Problem**: a lack of clear evidence and usage guidelines for how IML (e.g. better trust and debugging) may actually help consumers.
  - **Solution**: researchers and consumers should work together to identify well-defined *target use cases* as part of developing a diagnostic treatment of IML methods.



#### Discussion with Yang Zhao about domain identification and clustering `application` `data-centric` `domain adaptation`

- [Unsupervised Domain Clusters in Pretrained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02105.pdf), ACL 2020.

We read the above paper and learn about `GMM` clustering of dense sentence vectors, **purity** metrics for unsupervised evaluation of clustering.



#### What is `webdataset`? How about other toolbox for prototyping and creating DL projects? `toolkit`

> I would like to use the toolkits here to build research projects or toy applications in my spare time.

- [webdataset](https://github.com/webdataset), A high-performance Python-based I/O system for large (and small) deep learning problems, with strong support for PyTorch.
- [functorch](https://github.com/pytorch/functorch), functorch is a prototype of JAX-like composable function transforms for PyTorch.
- [python poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), `python` environment management.

#### How to get data resources for pre-training? `data-centric` `engineering`

- [Documenting Geographically and Contextually Diverse Data Sources: The BigScience Catalogue of Language Data and Resources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10066.pdf), Jan. 25 2022.

Jiaxing mentioned to me the following data resources for Chinese:

- [CLUECorpus2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01355.pdf), [github](https://github.com/CLUEbenchmark/CLUECorpus2020/)
- [wudao](https://github.com/TsinghuaAI/CPM) 200G(?)
